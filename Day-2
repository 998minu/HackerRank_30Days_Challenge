ðŸš€ Day 2 of #30daysofcodechallenge!! ðŸš€
Task: Operators âœ…
Task:
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.
Example:
A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value and return from the function.
Function Description:
Complete the solve function in the editor below.
solve has the following parameters:
int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax
int tip_percent: the tip percentage
int tax_percent: the tax percentage
Returns:
The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.
