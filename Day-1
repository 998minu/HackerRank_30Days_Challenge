Task: DataTypes âœ…
Declare Variables: Create three variables - one as an integer, one as a double, and one as a string.
Read Input: Obtain input for the declared variables from the user, following the specified sequence in the Input Format section.
Perform Operations: Utilize the "+" operator for the following tasks:
Print the sum of 4 plus your integer variable on a new line.
Print the sum of 4.0 plus your double variable, rounded to one decimal place, on a new line.
Concatenate the string you read as input with "HackerRank" and print the result on a new line.

Source Code:
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
public class DataType {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 4;
        double d = 4.0;
        String s = "HackerRank ";
        
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int in;
        double db;
        String str;

        in = scan.nextInt();
        db = scan.nextDouble();
        
        scan.nextLine();
        str = scan.nextLine();

        System.out.println(i+in);

        System.out.println(d+db);
        
        System.out.println(s.concat(str));
    }
}
